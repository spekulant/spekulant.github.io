            <p>I write artisan hand-crafted software for a living.</p>
            <p>
                Majority of the time I write it for a
                <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-decacorn-7500821"

                in the Energy industry. Helping drive global transition towards

                I use <strong>nix</strong>-darwin to control my Mac machine
                after enough tantrums with Brew.

                My weapon of choice is <strong>Go</strong>, but I'm actively
                working towards <strong>Rust</strong>. From other worthy
                mentions, I could probably write a generator in
                <strong>Python</strong> that would reproduce this same page, but
                in fewer keystrokes ;)

                I wrote a few open source tools and libraries, you can find them
                on my Github linked above.
