                    >TLDR - Having experimented with pure nix ways of handling
                    dmg images, I finally had to settle on an outside-sandbox
                    approach using the MacOS's built-in
                    <code>hdiutil</code> tool. Skip to the Final section to see
                    how it all ties together.</strong

            <p>
                Having learned about the superb
                <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed">zed editor</a>
                from the creators of Atom, I wanted to install it on my mac
                machine.
            <p>
            </p>
                My mac runs a nix-darwin setup with home-manager on
                top. A lovely combo, albeit a bit more difficult to update
                compared to competing solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My whole setup is relatively small and simple. And so normally,
                adding a new package is just extending my
                <code>home.packages</code> list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking for <code>zed</code> in the
                <a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages"
                    >nixos packages search tool</a
                >
                yielded some unrelated stuff initially. No editor package in
                sight.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I quickly realized the problem was I looked in the stable
                channel (23.11 atm). Upon switching to Unstable, I found what I
                was looking for. The name of the package is
                <code>zed-editor</code> in nix world.
            </p>
            <p>So I just added it to my home-manager packages:</p>
            <pre><code>home.packages = [
    ... # other packages
    pkgs.zed-editor
];
</code></pre>
            <p>
                Sadly, upon running <code>home-manager switch</code> I learned
                it won't do because it's an unstable channel and I haven't
                enabled unstable packages.
            </p>
            <p>
                But to at least try, I tried to install zed-editor in the
                current session:
            </p>
            <pre><code>nix-shell -p zed-editor
</code></pre>
            <p>
                This failed because the
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/636760666295252c4bbba6d4a2cb03b92ca0f862"
                    >zed-editor build process on darwin is broken</a
                >
                as of the time of writing. Looking up
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/303233#issuecomment-2048650618"
                    >the underlying issue</a
                >
                I found out it was due a darwin-specific dependency on
                <code>LiveKitBridge</code>
                (Swift) that fails to build.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, inspired by the helpful error message suggesting I may try
                to enable broken packages, just in case it turns out to be
                working, I tried again:
            </p>
            <pre><code>export NIXPKGS_ALLOW_BROKEN=1
nix-shell -p zed-editor
</code></pre>
            <p>
                This took a lot more time but eventually, the build failed due
                to a similar error as described in the github issue.
            </p>
            <h2>Core of the search</h2>
            <p>
                This made me think there must be a way to install this somehow
                as I checked that the pre-built distribution of the editor works
                fine on Macs.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are pre-build <code>.dmg</code> packages (images)
                available on zed's github releases page. So I started looking
                into installing those. This turned out to be a spiral of doom as
                the continued efforts of the community over the last almost 10
                years in reverse-engineering Apple's Volume formats were
                relentlessly shut down by Apple's ever-changing volume spec,
                starting with HFS then over to HFS+ and now finally at APFS.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried using <code>libdmg-hfsplus</code> , <code>undmg</code>,
                <code>xpwn</code>, <code>apfs-fuse</code> and
                <code>p7zip</code>. All of these turned out to either not work
                with the current format of the APFS images or me not being able
                to shake them (here, eg, xpwn) into doing the thing. This took
                me several iterations over a config that essentially looks
                something like this in my <code>darwin.nix</code>:
            </p>
            <pre><code>environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  # ... other packages
    (pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
      name = "zed";
      src = pkgs.fetchurl {
        url = "https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/releases/download/v0.135.2/Zed-x86_64.dmg";
        sha256 = "01e6ede9d5ab7e21e54e448e0a13f9d123b1106ce768a22483a8bac9285f083d";
      };
      buildInputs = [ pkgs.undmg pkgs.p7zip ];
      phases = [ "unpackPhase" "installPhase" ];
      unpackPhase = ''
        undmg $src
      '';
      installPhase = ''
        mkdir -p $out/Applications
        cp -r $out/Zed.app $out/Applications/Zed.app
      '';
    })
  ];
</code></pre>
            <p>
                The most promising candidate was <code>p7zip</code>, but as of
                the time of writing, the required update to extract APFS is
                merged into master, albeit not yet released.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having spent hours tweaking and wrangling the config, I wanted
                to find out if there perhaps is a way to reach out into the
                system's native tools outside the sandbox, leave the pure
                functional world, and just install the package.
            </p>
            <h2>Final</h2>
            <p>
                Turns out there is a relatively easy way to install this, you
                can execute arbitrary scripts in the post-setup stage, so as a
                last resort I just 'bash'ed this into a temporary form.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote a little <code>install_zed.sh</code> script that
                attempts to download, mount, and install the Zed release
                package:
            </p>
            <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
# Debugging: Print each command being executed
set -x
LOG_FILE="/tmp/install_zed.log"

{
    ZED_VERSION = "0.135.2"
    if [ -f "/Applications/Zed.app/Contents/MacOS/cli" ]; then
        INSTALLED_VERSION=$(/Applications/Zed.app/Contents/MacOS/cli --version)
        if [ "$INSTALLED_VERSION" == "Zed $ZED_VERSION - /Applications/Zed.app" ]; then
            echo "Chosen Zed version is already installed in /Applications"
            exit 0
        fi
    fi

    echo "Installing Zed v$ZED_VERSION..."

    URL="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/releases/download/v$ZED_VERSION/Zed-x86_64.dmg"
    MOUNT_POINT="/Volumes/Zed"
    DEST_DIR="/Applications"
    DMG_FILE=$(mktemp)

    echo "Downloading DMG to $DMG_FILE"
    curl -L $URL -o $DMG_FILE

    echo "Verifying DMG..."
    hdiutil verify $DMG_FILE

    echo "Mounting DMG..."
    hdiutil attach $DMG_FILE -mountpoint $MOUNT_POINT

    echo "Copying Zed to $DEST_DIR"
    cp -r $MOUNT_POINT/Zed.app $DEST_DIR/Zed.app

    echo "Unmounting DMG..."
    hdiutil detach $MOUNT_POINT

    echo "Cleaning up..."
    rm $DMG_FILE

    if [ -f /usr/local/bin/zed ]; then
        sudo unlink /usr/local/bin/zed
    fi
    sudo ln -s /Applications/Zed.app/Contents/MacOS/cli /usr/local/bin/zed

    echo "Zed installation complete!"
} 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee $LOG_FILE
</code></pre>
            <p>
                Here we use <code>hdiutil</code>, the native and pre-installed
                tool for mounting the MacOS DMG application images. I added a
                log file output redirection, trivial version control, and simple
                binary linking.
            </p>
            <p>
                This script lives in the same directory as all the rest of my
                nix config, and in my <code>darwin.nix</code> (so, nix-darwin
                config) I added this new
                <code>system.activationScripts</code> instance:
            </p>
            <pre><code>{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:

{
    # ... other config
    system.activationScripts.installZed.text = builtins.readFile /Users/tomaszsobota/h/install_zed.sh;
}
</code></pre>
            <p>
                Then, I ran <code>darwin-rebuild switch</code>, and it worked
                like a charm. Zed is now available in both my Spotlight search
                (Cmd+Space) and from cli with just <code>zed</code>.
            </p>
            <p>Thanks, see you in the next one.</p>
